      <description>While working on a network automation task, I encountered an error while trying to establish connections to some legacy devices: &amp;ldquo;Unable to negotiate with 10.2.100.22 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1, diffie-hellman-group14-sha1.&amp;rdquo;
In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through a few simple steps to resolve this issue and ensure smooth SSH connections.

      <description>I officially started my career in IT in 2006, but my first steps with networks occurred a few years before that, between 2002 and 2003.
In 2006, I began as an intern in user support at a government agency. I started by formatting computers and quickly progressed to a point where I dealt with the entire network infrastructure including switches, firewalls, proxy, file servers, AD, etc.
After completing this internship, I went to another company, again as an intern, where I spent another 2 years before being officially hired.</description>

      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore some Cisco IOS XE capabilities such as Streaming Telemetry and Guestshell.
There is a ton of content available on Cisco DevNet explaining Model-Driven Telemetry theory in great detail, so I highly suggest you take some time to browse through the links I&amp;rsquo;ve listed under the Reference of this post.
Summary My lab router is a Cisco ISR C1111-4G running IOS XE 17.6.3a. The same environment can be set up on a CSR1000v or Catalyst 8000v running on Cisco CML for example.</description>
