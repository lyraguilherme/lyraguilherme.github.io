We're back with another exciting episode of Routing Friends! This time, we'll talk about network automation and work through a hands-on lab with specific tools/frameworks to perform automation operations!

## Lab Guide

Clone the following repository:
[lyraguilherme on GitHub](https://github.com/lyraguilherme/LabHandsOn-Nov2024/)

In this repository you will find the presentation, topology and scripts that were used during the **Routing Friends - Lab Hands-on** held on November 21, 2024.

To use the scripts, you should preferably create a **venv**:
```shell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the venv:
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies with the command:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing all the dependencies, the scripts can be executed.
