In November 2020 I had the honor of being invited by Cisco Community to present a live event about **Cisco SD-WAN (Viptela)**. The event had more than 300 participants, from 9 different countries.

For those who want to know more about this excellent Cisco solution, the recording is available on the link below (presentation language is Brazilian Portuguese).
